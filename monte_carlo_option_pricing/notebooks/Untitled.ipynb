    "Path-dependent options, whose payoffs depend on the entire price trajectory rather than just the terminal price, pose significant challenges for analytical pricing methods. Options such as Asian options (averaging), barrier options (knock-in/knock-out), and lookback options (extrema) generally lack closed-form solutions, making Monte Carlo simulation a natural approach.\n",

    "1. Asset prices follow Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)\n",
    "2. Options are priced as discounted expected payoffs under the risk-neutral measure\n",
